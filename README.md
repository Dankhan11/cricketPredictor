CRICKET PREDICTOR

I made this to predict the winner of the IPL (Indian Premiere League) one of the biggest cricket leagues in the world.

- I made use of Random Forests
- Used sciKit learn and pandas
- Got data from IPL matches dating back to 2013

Issues with the dataset:

- Different acquisition of teams wihtin the IPL
- Name changes of teams
- Some teams do not qualify to be in the IPL therefore winners cannot be predicted
